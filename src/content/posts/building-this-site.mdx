I've had a personal site for a while. The problem is I spent more time tweaking it than actually writing on it. New framework, new design system, new color palette — always building, never publishing. So I scrapped it and made something as simple as possible.

## Design

I looked at [leerob.com](https://leerob.com) and [shud.in](https://shud.in) a lot. Both are mostly just text. No cards, no fancy layouts. That's what I wanted.

I started with more — shadcn/ui components, tag filters, dark mode, React islands. Ended up deleting all of it. Removing the tag filter meant I could drop React entirely. The site went from 200KB of client JS to zero.

## Stack

Astro, Tailwind, MDX, Shiki. No client JavaScript. Every page is static HTML and CSS. Astro's view transitions handle page navigation — fade animation, no full reload.

## Design system

One font does almost everything. Geist Sans for headings, body, titles — all of it. Geist Mono handles data: dates, code, tech stacks. Charter shows up only in blockquotes, where serif actually makes sense.

| Element | Size | Weight | Color |
|---------|------|--------|-------|
| Nav | 13px | normal | `neutral-400` |
| Page/article title | 22px | normal | `neutral-800` |
| Section heading (h2) | 17px | medium | `neutral-800` |
| Sub-heading (h3) | 15px | medium | `neutral-800` |
| Body text | 15px | normal | `neutral-500` |
| Post/project titles | 15px | normal | `neutral-800` |
| Dates | 12px mono | normal | `neutral-400` |
| Code | 13px mono | normal | `neutral-500` |

The hierarchy comes from color and weight, not size. Most text lives at 15px. Titles are 22px but normal weight — size creates presence, not boldness. The scale is tight on purpose. If everything is roughly the same size, nothing shouts.

Two colors do most of the work. `neutral-800` for anything you should read first. `neutral-500` for everything else. `neutral-400` for metadata you might not need. White background, no dark mode.

Links use a light underline (`neutral-200`) that darkens on hover. No color change, just weight.

## Structure

Three pages. About (homepage), writing (blog posts), and projects. That's it. Nav is just three text links at the top. No logo, no hamburger menu, no footer.

## Writing workflow

My old site used Keystatic as a CMS. It was nice but unnecessary for a one-person blog. Now I just create an `.mdx` file in the content folder, add frontmatter (title, description, date), and write. No admin panel, no deploy hooks, no auth. If I ever need a CMS again I can add one later — the content files stay the same.

## Process

I built this with AI. I made the decisions — stack, design, what stays, what goes. AI wrote the code. We went back and forth until it felt right.

That's how I work now. I still need to know what I want. The AI just gets me there faster.
